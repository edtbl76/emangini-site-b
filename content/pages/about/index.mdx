Hello there, I'm Ed.

I'm a technologist, writer, leader and businessperson. I've been fortunate to work at well-known companies like Amazon, Oracle, PTC, iRobot and Thoughtworks, but the true pleasure is something I can enjoy everywhere I go. It's the people. 

I love writing code, designing software and being a part of the delivery of innovative solutions, whether I'm a participant, a leader, or even asked to "get out and push." My passion is for spaces where problems are still fresh and the opportunities are emerging. Whether it is distributed systems, cloud computing, microservices, and now the "Sciences of Insight" (AI and data science), I love to with those who want to lean over the edge and look outward with excitement rather than down with fear. 

I'm formally educated (BA) in music and mathematics; an MBA with concentrations in Data Analytics, Strategy and Digital Transformation; and a pending MSc in Distributed Systems (Computer Science) and Artificial Intelligence. I am always reading, studying, and trying to acquire knowledge to satisfy a hunger that has yet to acquiese. Just as much as I enjoy learning, I enjoy the sharing of knowledge through teaching, coaching and mentoring. In fact, I love education so much, I married a teacher!

I'm also a dad, runner, husband, musician (less and less), dog enthusiast, and devotee of the fight sciences. These things are very important to
me, but I (usually) don't talk about them here!
