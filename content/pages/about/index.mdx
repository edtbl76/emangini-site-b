Hi!

I'm a technologist, architect, developer, and leader with a "v-shaped" passion for high level strategy, economies
of scale, distributed systems and the most sensible defaults for technology-driven value streams.

I'm an open source advocate, and I love leaving my fingerprints across various technical and functional domains.
I've delivered software, infrastructure, and architecture across a myriad of platforms, styles and industries.

I believe in peer leadership, motivating through empathy, cultivating through influence and coaching with positive
guidance.

I try to avoid absolutes as much as possible.
Trade-offs are everywhere, and we spend far too much time in the pursuit of 'best practices',
when good ones often get us value and feedback much faster.
